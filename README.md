## What is the Project for?
This Project is made for travelers. They can type in their planned trips

## How It works
The User has to type in a destination and a date when the user wants to start the trip. Once the User hits the save Button a travelcard disappears. The travelcard includes: the date, the destination, a Pic of the destination, the Weather Forecast and a Countdown. The User can add as many trips as he/she wants. It can remove trips by hitting the remove button 
## How to start it
